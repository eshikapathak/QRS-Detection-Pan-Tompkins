# QRS-Detection-Pan-Tompkins
Implemented the following Pan Tompkins adaptive thresholding algorithm for detecting QRS complexes in real-time-\
J. Pan and W. J. Tompkins, "A Real-Time QRS Detection Algorithm," in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, vol. BME-32, no. 3, pp. 230-236, March 1985, doi: 10.1109/TBME.1985.325532.

The algorthm detects QRS complexes and also reports the heart rate corresponding to the input ECG signal.\
I evaluated the QRS detection algorithm on 10 ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. I have included the results and explanation in the Jupyter notebook.

### Libraries used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib- pyplot
